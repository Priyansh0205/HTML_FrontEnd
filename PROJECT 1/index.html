                    <b>Swami Vivekananda</b> (12 January 1863 4 July 1902), born <b>Narendranath Datta</b> was an Indian
                    Hindu monk,
                    philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He
                    was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He is credited with
                    raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in the
                    late nineteenth century.

                <h3>Travels In India</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka a wandering monk, "without fixed abode,
                    without ties,
                    independent and strangers wherever they go". His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot),
                    staff and his two
                    favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in
                    India for five
                    years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and
                    social
                    patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift
                    the
                    nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), he travelled on foot and by railway. During his travels
                    he met and
                    stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims,
                    Christians,
                    paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials. On the suggestion of his patron, friend and
                    disciple Raja
                    Ajit Singh of Khetri, he adopted the name "Vivekananda"a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka
                    and ānanda, meaning
                    "the bliss of discerning wisdom". As Vivekananda he departed Bombay for Chicago, on 31 May 1893,
                    intending to
                    participate in the World's Parliament of Religions.
